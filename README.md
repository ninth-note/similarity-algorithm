# similarity-algorithm (cosine similarity)

  1. Simple algorithm for calculating similarity of document to a query using cosine similarity
  2. For the time being it will only be the algorithm with no proper tests or a handy input system, however might add this later,
     you can however actually use it by manually adding the documents and query to the calc_similarity_test() and then using the 
     calc_similarity() function to work out the similarity as can be seen in the code.
